## Bio

I am a self-taught R programmer, formally educated in sociology, philosophy, religion, and photography. Researchers and business leaders appreciate that I understand their needs. Software teams appreciate that I understand their needs. At that intersection I develop Shiny applications that help researchers, analysts, and decision makers create meaning from data.

I started my career shortly after 9/11 as a US Army intelligence analyst focused on North Korea, which quickly shifted to researching al-Qaeda ideology, propaganda, and recruiting. This soon expanded to all associated extremist groups around the world. In 2010 I landed in Afghanistan as a defense contractor providing research support to a group of astonishingly young Army and civilian interrogators at the main US detention facility in Bagram.

Disillusioned with that experience I returned to school full-time as an adult student in 2011, working occasionally as a professional photographer and commercial image retoucher. By 2016, I began teaching myself the R programming language in order to restart a career in research and analysis. The same year I began my first job as an R programmer in a technology company.

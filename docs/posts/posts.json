I built this little web app that scrapes all Union general names from Wikipedia, then identifies the first letter of their last name and how many syllables are in that name. Click on a Confederate-named base and see all Union generals who match the first letter and number of syllables. I even found some Google fonts that are similar to 19-century fonts.\nI use the rvest package to scrape the tables from Wikipedia. I count syllables with the nsyllable() function from the quanteda package. With purrr’s pmap() function I iterate over each Union general to make a Shiny UI element that formats each general’s name and ranks into a card format. All layout for the Shiny app is done with CSS Flexbox.\nSee the web app here.\nAll the code is on my GitHub.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nProblem: How do I get all the complaints, affidavits, and indictments (all at once!) for everyone charged so far in the attack on the U.S. Capitol?\nSolution: R’s tidyverse is a good way. The rvest package has easy functions for scraping the web.\nIn this article I will use only tidyverse packages. I’ll show you exploratory data analysis, how to loop through an HTML table with the rvest and purrr packages, automatically create unique folders on your system for each set of documents, and use the amazing polite package to handle identifying ourselves to the web host and limiting our activity on their server so that we do not cause harm.\n\n\nlibrary(assertthat)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(polite)\nlibrary(fs)\n\n\n\nAll of the documents we want are on this page of the United States District Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. The page is mostly a big HTML table with a row for each defendant. A documents column contains all the documents for each person.\nUsing functions from the polite package, we start by creating a session then scraping the HTML from the webpage. This does not give us the PDF documents, though.\n\n\ncases_url <- \"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/capitol-breach-cases\"\n\n# from the polite package, we properly identify ourselves and respect any explicit limits\nsession <- bow(cases_url, force = TRUE)\n\n# scrape the page contents\ncases_page <- scrape(session)\n\n\n\nNow that we have the HTML content we do a little exploratory data analysis to see how everything is organized and decide how we want to download all the defendant documents.\nHow many cases do we have?\n\n\n# extract the HTML table from the page content\ncases_table <- cases_page %>% \n html_node(\"table\") %>% \n html_table()\n\n# How many cases do we have?\ncases_table %>%\n  pull(`Case Number`) %>%\n  n_distinct()\n\n\n[1] 159\n\nHow many defendants do we have?\n\n\n# How many defendants do we have?\ncases_table %>%\n  pull(`Name`) %>%\n  n_distinct()\n\n\n[1] 199\n\nIf any defendant names are duplicated, let’s see them.\n\n\n# if any defendant names are duplicated, let's see them\nif (cases_table %>%\n    pull(Name) %>%\n    duplicated() %>%\n    any()) {\n  \n  cases_table %>%\n    count(Name, sort = TRUE) %>% \n    filter(n > 1) %>% \n    arrange(desc(n))\n  \n}\n\n\n\nIf any case numbers are duplicated, let’s see them.\n\n\n# if any case numbers are duplicated, let's see them\nif (cases_table %>%\n    pull(`Case Number`) %>%\n    duplicated() %>%\n    any()) {\n  \n  cases_table %>% \n    group_by(`Case Number`) %>% \n    mutate(n = n()) %>% \n    ungroup() %>% \n    select(n, `Case Number`, everything()) %>% \n    arrange(desc(n), `Case Number`, Name) \n  \n  # now we can see who all is in each case when there are more than one\n  \n}\n\n\n# A tibble: 199 x 8\n       n `Case Number` Name  `Charge(s)` `Associated Doc…\n   <int> <chr>         <chr> <chr>       <chr>           \n 1    11 \"\"            FAIR… Civil Diso… \"Fairlamb, Scot…\n 2    11 \"\"            JACK… Assaulting… \"Jackson, Emanu…\n 3    11 \"\"            JOHN… Obstructio… \"Johnatakis - I…\n 4    11 \"\"            MEGG… Conspiracy… \"Meggs Steele Y…\n 5    11 \"\"            MEGG… Conspiracy… \"Meggs Steele Y…\n 6    11 \"\"            NORD… Aid and Ab… \"Nordean - Comp…\n 7    11 \"\"            PETE… Knowingly … \"Peterson, Russ…\n 8    11 \"\"            SIMO… Restricted… \"Simon, Mark - …\n 9    11 \"\"            STEE… Conspiracy… \"Meggs Steele Y…\n10    11 \"\"            WILL… Knowingly … \"Williams, Rile…\n# … with 189 more rows, and 3 more variables: `Location of\n#   Arrest` <chr>, `Case Status` <chr>, `Entry Last Updated*` <chr>\n\nHow many documents do we have?\n\n\n# How many documents do we have?\ncases_table %>%\n  pull(`Associated Documents`) %>%\n  n_distinct()\n\n\n[1] 173\n\nWe want to know if there is a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship between any cases and documents. When we look at the documents column we can see that some people have the same associated documents. BROWN, Terry; CURZIO, Michael; FITCHETT, Cindy; GALLAGHER, Thomas; SWEET, Douglas all share the same “Fitchett et al - Complaint Fitchett et al - Statement of Facts Fitchett -Indictment” document. We must decide if we want to download that document just once or once for each person it’s associated with.\nWhen I last ran this code there were 169 unique document names in the column, but we really need to see how many unique document download links there are.\n\n\ndefendant_names <- cases_page %>%\n  html_nodes(\"td\") %>%\n  html_nodes(\"a\") %>%\n  html_attr('href') %>%\n  str_remove(\"/usao-dc/defendants/\")\n  \n# make a table of just download info\ndownload_links <- tibble(\n  link_names = cases_page %>% # making the link_names column \n    html_nodes(\"td\") %>% # links from html table, not from elsewhere in page\n    html_nodes(\"a\") %>%\n    html_text(),\n  link_urls = cases_page %>% # making the link_urls column\n    html_nodes(\"td\") %>% \n    html_nodes(\"a\") %>%\n    html_attr('href') %>% \n    str_c(\"https://www.justice.gov\", .) # paste on the missing domain\n) %>% # table is complete, now keep only rows with download links\n  filter(str_detect(link_urls, \"download$\")) %>% \n  unique() # no duplicates\n\n# How many unique document download links?\ndownload_links %>% pull(link_urls) %>% n_distinct()\n\n\n[1] 331\n\nHmm, so the HTML table had 169 document names but 322 unique download links. I’m guessing that a single document about multiple defendants gets a unique download link each time it’s listed for a unique defendant. Now I don’t think it will be easy to avoid downloading duplicate documents.\nWe want to keep everything organized by defendant, so we are going to loop through each row of the table and capture the download links per defendant, then while downloading we will save documents to a folder unique to each defendant even if that means the same document ends up in multiple folders.\nLet’s get the contents of each row into a list but drop the header row. Here we use html_nodes(\"tr\") from the rvest package to target table rows, which outputs an xml nodeset, but we want a regular R list, so we use map() from the purrr package to extract the table cells into a list.\n\n\n# Let's get the contents of each row into a list but drop the header row.\nrows <- cases_page %>%\n  html_nodes(\"tr\") %>% \n  map(~html_nodes(., \"td\")) %>% # gets cell content per row\n  compact() # drops empty header row\n\n\n\nNow we can iterate through each element of this list (a row from the HTML table) and do whatever we want. Let’s create a function to do what we want, then map that function over each list element.\nThe main jobs of this function are\nget the defendant’s name\nget list of download urls for their documents\ncreate a filename no longer than 45 characters for each document\ndownload docs into a folder named after defendant, also no longer than 45 characters\n\n\n# function that downloads all the docs\ndownload_defendant_docs <- function(row) {\n  \n  # get the defendant's name\n  # get list of download urls for their documents\n  # create a filename no longer than 45 characters for each document\n  # download docs into folder named after defendant\n  \n  message(\"**************************************************\")\n  \n  # who is the defendant in this row?\n  defendant <- row %>%\n    html_children() %>% \n    html_text() %>% \n    first()\n  \n  # clean the name so we can use it as a folder name\n  # and just in case any rows are missing a name, we will give them 'no_name'\n  if (nchar(defendant) > 0) {\n    defendant <- defendant %>%\n      str_replace_all(\"&\", \"and\") %>% \n      str_replace_all(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9]\", \"_\") %>% # replace all non alpha-numeric\n      str_replace_all(\"_{2,3}\", \"_\") %>% # replace extra underscores with single underscore\n      str_remove(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9]$\") %>% # remove any non-alpha-numeric at the end\n      str_to_lower()\n  } else {\n    defendant <- \"no_name\"\n  }\n  \n  # limit defendant names to 45 characters\n  if (nchar(defendant) > 45) {\n      defendant <- str_extract(defendant, \"^.{45}\")\n    }\n  \n  assert_that(\n    inherits(defendant, \"character\"),\n    length(defendant) > 0\n  )\n  \n  # there can be more than one document for a defendant so let's get the docs into a list\n  urls_to_download <- row %>%\n    html_children() %>% \n    html_nodes(\"a\") %>% \n    html_attr(\"href\") %>% \n    map(~str_c(\"https://www.justice.gov\", .)) # add missing domain on all links\n  \n  assert_that(\n    inherits(urls_to_download, \"list\"),\n    length(urls_to_download) > 0,\n    # make sure there are no NAs\n    map(urls_to_download, is.na) %>% unlist() %>% sum() == 0\n  )\n  \n  doc_names <- row %>%\n    html_children() %>% \n    html_nodes(\"li\") %>% # doc links are in html list tags\n    html_text() %>% \n    as.list() %>% \n    map(~str_remove(., \".pdf\")) %>% # a few filenames have .pdf inside the filename\n    map(~str_replace_all(., \"&\", \"and\")) %>% \n    map(~str_replace_all(., \"[^a-zA-Z0-9]\", \"_\")) %>% # replace all non alpha-numeric\n    map(~str_replace_all(., \"_{2,3}\", \"_\")) %>% # replace extra underscores with single underscore\n    map(~str_to_lower(.)) %>% \n    # limit filenames to 45 characters\n    modify_if(.p = ~nchar(.x) > 45, .f = ~str_extract(.x, \"^.{45}\")) %>% \n    map(~str_c(., \".pdf\")) # append .pdf to all filenames\n  \n  assert_that(\n    inherits(doc_names, \"list\"),\n    length(doc_names) > 0,\n    map(doc_names, is.na) %>% unlist() %>% sum() == 0\n  )\n  \n  # make sure we have the same number of urls and document names\n  assert_that(\n    length(urls_to_download) == length(doc_names)\n  )\n  \n  # a friendly message that will appear in the console each time this function runs\n  message(str_c(\"... have defendant, doc names, and links, proceeding to download for: \", defendant, \"\\n\"))\n  \n  # Confirm or create a download folder and defendant folder. The dir functions\n  # are from the fs package. The here() function is from the here package, and it helps\n  # us make file paths.\n  if (!dir_exists(here(\"downloads\"))) {\n    dir_create(here(\"downloads\"))\n  }\n  \n  if (!dir_exists(here(\"downloads\", defendant))) {\n    dir_create(here(\"downloads\", defendant))\n  }\n  \n  #---- politely download the files (will wait 5 seconds between each) ----\n\n  # function that will take a url and filename and do the downloads politley\n  get_doc <- function(url , filename) {\n    nod(session, url) %>% # nod and rip are from the polite package\n      rip(destfile = filename,\n          path = here(\"downloads\", defendant),\n          overwrite = TRUE)\n  }\n  \n  # Map our function over the two lists, but first put them in a single list\n  # that gets passed to pmap()\n  list(url = urls_to_download, filename = doc_names) %>% \n    pmap(safely(get_doc)) # wrapped in safely so it won't stop on error\n\n  message(str_c(\"...finished downloads for: \", defendant, \"\\n\\n\\n\"))\n  \n} # end function\n\n\n\nJust before running our main function I like to print a few messages to console\n\n\nmessage(str_c(\"There are \", length(rows), \" rows from wich to download documents\", \"\\n\"))\nmessage(str_c(\"There are \", nrow(download_links), \" documents to download\", \"\\n\"))\nmessage(str_c(\"There will be a 5-second pause between each document\", \"\\n\"))\nmessage(str_c(\"See https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/reference/set_delay.html for more details\", \"\\n\\n\"))\n\n\n\nThe last thing to do is map the function over our list of rows with:\nmap(rows, download_defendant_docs)\nWow that seems like a lot of work to get to those documents! Initially it was. But stepping through all of the exploratory data analysis is important to know what to expect and how to write our functions to handle different possibilities.\nIf you run this, you will be downloading over 300 PDF files with a 5-second pause between each one. So refill that coffee!\nIf you want the code all in one piece you get it from my Github here.\n\n\n\n",

Then we will join the state’s closing and reopening dates onto our COVID counts for each state.\n\n\nplot_dat <- states[\n  , `:=`( # get new cases and deaths per day by subtracting previous day (lag)\n      new_cases =  cases - shift(cases,  type = \"lag\", n = 1L),\n      new_deaths = deaths -shift(deaths, type = \"lag\", n = 1L)\n    )\n    , by = state\n  ][ # rolling avergaes for new cases and new deaths by state\n    , `:=`(\n      nc_avg = frollmean(new_cases,  7L, align = \"right\"),\n      nd_avg = frollmean(new_deaths, 7L, align = \"right\")\n    )\n    , by = state\n  ][ # round them all up using ceiling\n    , c(\"nc_avg\", \"nd_avg\") := lapply(.SD, ceiling), .SDcols = c(\"nc_avg\", \"nd_avg\")\n  ][ # join the closing and reopening dates\n    stay_at_home_table, on = \"state\"\n  ][\n    , plot_label_end := \"REOPEN\"\n  ][\n    , plot_label_start := \"CLOSE\"\n  ]\n\n\nPlotting all the data for each state would be too much for this blog post. Instead, I’ll pick two states and plot their daily death counts, 7-day rolling averages, and closing and opening dates.\n\n\n# colors\nmain_blue <- \"#abbfd3\"\naccent_light <- \"#eef2f6\"\naccent_dark <- \"#698cb0\"\ngrey_dark <- \"#627384\"\nrestriction_red <- \"#f47171\"\nreopen_green <- \"#24a8a8\"\n\n# max date for x axis\nmax_plot_date <- max(\n  Sys.Date(),\n  plot_dat[state %chin% c(\"Texas\", \"Michigan\"),\n           max(end, na.rm = TRUE)]\n)\n\nplot_dat[state %chin% c(\"Texas\", \"Michigan\"), ] %>% \n      ggplot(aes(x = date, y = new_deaths)) + \n      geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n               fill = main_blue,\n               color = accent_light,\n               width = 1,\n               alpha = .4) +\n      geom_smooth(aes(x = date, y = nd_avg),\n                  method = \"loess\",\n                  color = accent_dark,\n                  se = FALSE,\n                  size = .5) +\n      geom_text(aes(x = as.Date(\"2020-03-11\"), y = 0.01,\n                    label = \"PANDEMIC 3/11\"),\n                size = 2, angle = 90, vjust = 0, hjust = 0, color = grey_dark) +\n      geom_text(aes(x = start, y = 0.01, label = plot_label_start),\n                size = 2, angle = 90, vjust = 0, hjust = 0, color = restriction_red) +\n      geom_text(aes(x = end, y = 0.01, label = plot_label_end),\n               size = 2, angle = 90, vjust = 0, hjust = 0, color = reopen_green) +\n      scale_x_date(limits = c(as.Date(\"2020-03-10\"), max_plot_date), breaks = \"1 week\") +\n      facet_wrap(~state, scales = \"free\",\n                 ncol = 1) +\n      labs(y = \"\",\n           x = \"\",\n           title = \"New Deaths by Day Since March 11th 2020\",\n           subtitle = \"on March 11th, 2020 the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic\",\n           caption = \"Dataviz by Jeremy Allen | COVID data by The New York Time | Open Close Dates by Ballotpedia\") +\n      theme(\n        axis.ticks = element_line(color = accent_dark, size = .3),\n        axis.line.x = element_line(color = accent_dark, size = .3),\n        axis.text = element_text(color = \"#627384\", size = 8),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5),\n        axis.title = element_text(color = \"#627384\", size = 8),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = accent_light, color = accent_light),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = accent_light, color = accent_light),\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = accent_light, color = accent_light),\n        strip.text = element_text(color = \"#627384\", size = 12, hjust = 0,\n                                  margin = unit(c(10,10,10,10), \"pt\")),\n        plot.title = element_text(color = \"#627384\", size = 20,\n                                  margin = unit(c(2,10,5,0), \"pt\")),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"#627384\", size = 14,\n                                     margin = unit(c(5,10,20,0), \"pt\")),\n        plot.caption = element_text(color = \"#627384\", size = 6),\n        plot.margin = unit(c(15,40,15,40), \"pt\"),\n        panel.spacing = unit(70, \"pt\")\n      )\n\n\n\n\n",
